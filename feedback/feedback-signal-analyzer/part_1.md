# Development Plan for Signal Analyzer Service - Part 1

## Background and Objectives
The Signal Analyzer Service evaluates the historical performance of recorded signals. It calculates metrics like profitability and success rate, storing the results for downstream consumption.

## Phase 1: Module Initialization and Data Preparation

### Tasks
1. **Module Configuration**:
   - Define `SignalAnalyzerModule` in the `apps/signal-analyzer` directory.
   - Inject dependencies such as repositories for signals and transactions.

2. **Database Schema Definitions**:
   - **Signal History Table**:
     - `signal_id`: Unique identifier for the signal.
     - `timestamp`: Time the signal was recorded.
     - `token_id`: Token recommended by the signal.
   - **Transaction History Table**:
     - Contains transaction records for each token (price, volume, etc.).
   - **Signal Evaluation Results Table**:
     - `evaluation_id`: Unique identifier for the evaluation result.
     - `signal_id`: Associated signal.
     - `profitability`: Profitability of the recommended token.
     - `success_rate`: Success rate of the recommended token.
     - `evaluation_timestamp`: Time of the evaluation.

### Deliverables
1. `SignalAnalyzerModule` configured with dependencies.
2. Database schema definitions for signal evaluations.
