# Development Plan for Signal Analyzer Service - Part 2

## Phase 2: Core Signal Analysis Logic

### Tasks
1. **Signal History Data Retrieval**:
   - Implement `SignalRepository` for querying signal history.
   - Fetch signal records within a specified time range.

2. **Transaction History Data Retrieval**:
   - Implement `TransactionRepository` for querying transaction history.
   - Retrieve transaction data for tokens recommended by signals.

3. **Signal Evaluation Logic**:
   - In `SignalAnalyzerService`, implement the following methods:
     - `analyzeSignal(signalId: string)`:
       - Fetch the signal's associated transaction history.
       - Calculate profitability (price change of the recommended token).
       - Calculate success rate (frequency of achieving predefined goals).
     - `bulkAnalyzeSignals()`:
       - Batch process multiple signals.

### Deliverables
1. `SignalRepository` and `TransactionRepository` for data retrieval.
2. Core evaluation methods in `SignalAnalyzerService`.
